# COVID-19 data with SIR model [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/lisphilar/covid19-sir)](https://github.com/lisphilar/covid19-sir/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
This is a package for COVID-19 data analysis with SIR-derived models. Please refer to [COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) notebook in Kaggle to understand the methods of analysis.

## Introduction
With this Python package we can apply SIR-F model to COVID-19 data. SIR-F is a customized ODE model derived from SIR model. To evaluate the effect of measures, parameter estimation of SIR-F will be applied to subsets of time series data in each country. Parameter change points will be determined by S-R trend analysis. The details are explained in [COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) in Kaggle.
