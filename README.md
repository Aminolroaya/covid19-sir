This is a repository related to [COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) notebook in Kaggle. Please refer to the notebook to understand the method of analysis.

## Introduction
With this Python package we can apply SIR-F model to COVID-19 data. SIR-F is a customized ODE model derived from SIR model. To evaluate the effect of measures, parameter estimation of SIR-F will be applied to subsets of time series data in each country. Parameter change points will be determined by S-R trend analysis. The details are explained in [COVID-19 data with SIR model](https://www.kaggle.com/lisphilar/covid-19-data-with-sir-model) in Kaggle.
